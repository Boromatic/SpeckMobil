SpeckMobil
==========

SpeckMobil is an experimental open source (GPLv3) software for entering diagnostic mode in automotive controlling units via CAN-bus. You need a cable with an ELM327 chip (Bluetooth is tested to be working).

Because the software is only for experimental use. Do not use it when you're not sure what you're doing. The main intention is to show how VW-specific diagnostic protocol is working.
